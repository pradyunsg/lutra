Hey Pradyun!

You want to do the following before a public release:

- Add a "back to top" thing that behaves like mkdocs-material's. It shows up at the top of the page, when the user scrolls upwards.
- Figure out a way to have a feedback widget, that has faces as buttons, that open a new tab for the user to provide their feedback, with it pre-filled for them based on their response. This might be achievable as a form (or multiple)?
